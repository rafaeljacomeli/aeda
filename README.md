`AEDA` is a Python library to automate multiple Exploratory Data Analysis techniques.

As output, the algorithm generates a PDF report with all the analyses.


## Features
The algorithm was created to extract and process the following analyses:
* Dataset Info & Describe
* Temporal Analysis (Consistency, Distribution)
* Pearson Correlation and Golden Features
* Data and Model Explanation (Shapley Value, Lime, Interpret)
* Outlier Analysis - `Coming soon`
* Multivariate Analysis - `Coming soon`
